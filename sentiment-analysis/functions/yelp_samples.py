This place is fresh and great for these summer days in Vegas! If you're e craving a delicious cup of Boba and some kun fu clips, this place is must go!!!\\n\\n\\nNeed I say the service is also very good? If we are unhappy with our drinks they would be glad to remake it. Not like I need that option anyway...",

I am starting to sample the other drinks and the staff can help make suggestion and explain what are the different drinks they offer.  I have tried other boba drink shops and this by far is my favorite. Give them a try if you are looking for something a little out of the ordinary.",

        "text": "I didn't realize how many Yelpers had dogs. Such a great event  and the perfect weather to go with it.  Scottsdale Artwalk  is the place to be on Thursday.  Lori Landis opened her studio for us and let us enjoy her work.  She explained her artwork and passion to create beautiful things.  Ben an d Jack's Steakhouse provided some lite bites of chicken, steak and mac-n-cheese.  Sprinkles provided cupcakes for everyone, even the dogs.  \\n\\nAfter a visit at Lori's studio, we go to check out her neighbors and the surrounding studios along the Art Walk.  A big thank you to Lori and the galleries that allowed the Yelpers and their 4-legged friends to visit.  Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp for planning such a nice outing in Old Town.",

The person I was with had the chicken protein bowl with forbidden rice and sweet potato hash...also quite good.  I will definitely be back on a regular basis...really nice to have a healthy food option for a lunch/dinner out!",

The food was delicious, the staff was friendly- they answered all questions and helped us decide what to get. This place is a hidden gem! The tamale was HUGE and unlike anything I've ever had. We will definitely return!",

HUH? 2.8 miles and you don't deliver to me?  No wonder you can be freaky fast, you only deliver to places that are 2 blocks away.  Good business model, don't deliver to people in your same area.",

He asked if I wanted to place the order over the phone with him or online? Why would I call the store and tell him that I wanted to place an order for delivery if my intent was in any way to place my order online. What a moron!  I'll have nothing thanks!    1:00 PM.

        "text": "This has got to be a joke. The chicken shawarma has the texture of sawdust, the Kibbe tastes like mini corn dogs, and to get the combo is 2 extra dollars to add a drink. You read that correctly. It reminds me of chuckie cheese on the inside; bright neon colors, video games. All I could keep saying as I entered the door was,\\\"Disco-disco\\\" as the LED disco ball was making its rotations; all the while making zohan tag lines. I'm confident my insides are layered in a thick film of grease from the amazing minced beef inside the kibbeh. Friendly, but irritated staff made the experience all the more merry as Christmas music blazed from the speaker system. I'm a bit of a Connoisseur of arabic food and in my opinion, this place fell short of taste, flavor, and originality.",
